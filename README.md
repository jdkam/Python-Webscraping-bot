# Python-Webscraping-bot

A python script written to practice the functionality of webscraping.
The script will go to the nike website for their hoodie product page and
retrieve the colorway of the product, along with their price,
and its link to purchase.

The scraped data is then entered into a csv file, where the data can be viewed spreadsheet style in
a program like microsoft excel.
